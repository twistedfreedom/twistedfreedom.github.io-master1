	<p>I was born in Kansas City, Missouri and I grew up in Germantown, Maryland. After I graduated highschool I went to college in Tennessee. I then moved to Arizona where I became a certified mechanic, and eventually moved to Washington state to return to college to finish my education. I became disabled while living in Washington which changed my career path from nurse to Technical Communication major at Eastern Washington University.
